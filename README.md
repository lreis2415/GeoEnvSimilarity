# GeoSimilarity
The repository for codes in python and ```R``` and ```Python``` version of computational functions implementing the applications of geographic similarity. 

## Geographic Similarity
Locations with similar geographic environment would also have similar values (process) of geographic variables. This is referred to as the geographic similarity principle, i.e., the Third Law of Geography.
This has been widely applied to spatial analysis such as spatial prediction, sample design.

## solim.r
The core function of SoLIM in the version of R.
SoLIM (Soil-Land Inference Model) is the inference model that predicts soil based on the similarity of the lanscape. This is the spatial inference model based on the Third Law of Geography.

## individualPredictiveMapping.py
The core function of iPSM (individual predictive soil mapping) in the version of Python.
